                                                    mainland Asia by a land bridge and stone age hunters were able to
                                                    walk across. When the ice age ended about 10,000 BC Japan became a
                                                    group of islands.
                                                    About 8,000 BC the ancient Japanese learned to make pottery. The
                                                    period from 8,000 BC to 300 BC is called the Jomon. The word Jomon
                                                    means 'cord marked' because those people marked their pottery by
                                                    wrapping a cord around it. The Jomon people lived by hunting,
                                                    fishing and collecting shellfish. The Jomon made tools of stone,
                                                    wood, and bone. They also made clay figurines of people and animals
                                                    called dogu.</p>

                                                    Between 300 BC and 300 AD a new era began in Japan. At that time the
                                                    Japanese learned to grow rice. They also learned to make tools of
                                                    bronze and iron. The Japanese also learned to weave cloth.
                                                    This period is called Yayoi. (It was named after a village called
                                                    Yayoicho). Farming meant a more settled lifestyle. Yayoi people
                                                    lived in villages of wooden huts. Farming and other skills also
                                                    meant society became divided into classes. The leaders of Yayoi
                                                    society were buried in mounds away from the ordinary people's burial

                                                    sculptures are perfect examples of the uncanny valley — the feelings
                                                    of revulsion and uneasiness one experiences from non-human objects
                                                    that appear a bit too similar to real human beings. Japan seems to
                                                    excel at this in areas like robotics technology, and indeed, the
                                                    term “uncanny valley” itself was coined in 1970 by a Japanese
                                                    roboticist, Masahiro Mori. Iwasaki takes this concept out into
                                                    nature, blurring the line between flesh and wood.</p>
                                                <p class="text-left">Over the past 25 years, Iwasaki has been crafting
                                                    these sculptures as part of a collection he simply calls “torso.”
                                                    The sculptures themselves are life-sized at around 180 centimeters
                                                    tall, or 5 feet 9 inches and made entirely of driftwood the artist
                                                    collects in various locations in Japan. No one sculpture is exactly
                                                    like another which makes them all seem like individuals with their
                                                    own quirks and personalities. Descriptions of Iwasaki’s sculptures
                                                    by viewers run the gamut from scary, unsettling, and imposing, to
                                                    profound, intriguing, and otherworldly.</p>
