                                    <p class="text-left">The territory extends 377,975.24 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi). It is the 4th largest island country in the world and the largest island country in East Asia. Japan has the sixth longest coastline 29,751 km (18,486 mi) and the eighth largest Exclusive Economic Zone of 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi) in the world.</p>
                                    <p class="text-left">The terrain is mostly rugged and mountainous with 66% forest. The population is clustered in urban areas on the coast, plains and valleys. Japan is located in the northwestern Ring of Fire on multiple tectonic plates. East of the Japanese archipelago are three oceanic trenches. The Japan Trench is created as the oceanic Pacific Plate subducts beneath the continental Okhotsk Plate. The continuous subduction process causes frequent earthquakes, tsunami and stratovolcanoes. The islands are also affected by typhoons. The subduction plates have pulled the Japanese archipelago eastward, created the Sea of Japan and separated it from the Asian continent by back-arc spreading 15 million years ago.</p>
                                    <p class="text-left">The climate of the Japanese archipelago varies from humid continental in the north (Hokkaido) to humid subtropical and tropical rainforest in the south (Okinawa Prefecture). These differences in climate and landscape have allowed the development of a diverse flora and fauna, with some rare endemic species, especially in the Ogasawara Islands.</p>
                                    <p class="text-left">Japan extends from 20° to 45° north latitude (Okinotorishima to Benten-jima) and from 122° to 153° east longitude (Yonaguni to Minami Torishima). Japan is surrounded by seas. To the north the Sea of Okhotsk separates it from the Russian Far East, to the west the Sea of Japan separates it from the Korean Peninsula, to the southwest the East China Sea separates the Ryukyu Islands from China and Taiwan, to the east is the Pacific Ocean.</p>

Tokyo also is the center of otaku culture in Akihabara with a plethora of game, anime, and electronics shops; while the Harajuku and Shibuya districts are known worldwide for their contributions to fashion and kawaii (cute) culture. However, traditional culture is still very much alive in Tokyo, with a number of shrines and temples throughout the city, festivals held throughout the year, and also the world’s largest sumo stadium.</p>

Osaka has one of the world’s largest public aquariums and is home to Universal Studios Japan.

The city has around 2,000 temples and shrines, including the “Golden Pavilion,” Kinkakuji, Ryoanji known for its zen rock garden, and Fushimi Inari Taisha, the shrine with a tunnel of 5,000 vermillion torii gates. One of the most talked-about areas of Kyoto is the “geisha district” of Gion. While geiko (the Kyoto term for geisha) and maiko (apprentice geiko) are known for being elusive, if you are lucky, you just may encounter one of the kimono-adorned beauties taking a stroll! Art and history lovers will also not want to miss the Kyoto National Museum, which houses over 230 designated National Treasures and Important Cultural Properties.</p>

Because of its unique geography, it made sense to include Okinawa Prefecture as a whole. Okinawa is Japan’s southernmost prefecture, made up of 160 islands. It is known for its subtropical climate that is home to many rare species of plants and animals. White sand beaches and clear, blue waters of colorful fish make Okinawa the prime place to visit for those interested in swimming, snorkeling, and scuba diving, while still exploring Japan. This collection of islands, known also by its older name, Ryukyu, have a unique culture of its own, which has been integrated into the more typically represented traditional Japanese culture.</p>

The temple was originally associated with the Hosso sect, one of the oldest schools within Japanese Buddhism, but formed its own Kita Hosso sect in 1965. In 1994, the temple was added to the list of UNESCO world heritage sites.</p>

The walk around the upper precincts is a pleasant day hike. It also makes for a delightfully eerie stroll in the late afternoon and early evening, when the various graveyards and miniature shrines along the path take on a mysterious air.</p>
                                                    <p class="text-left">This shrine, dedicated to the god of rice and sake in the 8th century, also features dozens of statues of foxes. The fox is seen as the messenger of the god of grain foods, Inari, and the stone foxes are often known by the same name. The keys often depicted in the fox mouths are keys to granaries. This shrine is the central location for some 40,000 Inari shrines throughout the entirety of Japan.</p>

The architectural style developed over many generations and is designed to withstand the large amounts of heavy snow that falls in the region during winter. The roofs, made without nails, provided a large attic space used for cultivating silkworms.</p>
